Social-Network-Analysis-of-Les-Miserables
=========================================

This is a C program that I wrote in my first year of college as part of a project. The program searches through the Les Miserables book and pairs characters together whose names occur within a certain amount of lines together. The final output it a txt file with all the name pairs.
